# Puma Competitor Analysis

## Archetype
Puma often uses the **Explorer** archetype, appealing to athletes and creative consumers who want performance and style. The brand also taps into the **Creator** archetype through collaborations with designers and artists (e.g., FENTY by Rihanna, A$AP Rocky).

## Persuasion Techniques
- **Social Proof**: Celebrity collaborations (Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Neymar Jr.) highlight credibility.  
- **Scarcity & Urgency**: Limited-edition drops create FOMO.  
- **Authority**: Sponsorships in sports (track, soccer, basketball).  
- **Liking**: Relatable models and diverse campaigns.  
- **Reciprocity**: Discounts for students, seasonal promotions.
