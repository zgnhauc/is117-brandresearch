# Reebok's Persuasion methods
<p> Another competitor to Nike and how their persuasion methods differ is Reebok. Their approach, by featuring a collection in collaboration with WNBA player Angel Reese is vert similar in the vein of authority as Nike's collaboration. Where these deviate is they paint her more as "the hero" and not a ruler, as we saw with Labron James. Reebok's decision to collaborate with Angel Reese comes at an oportune time as she also walked the runway for this year's Victoria's Secret Show. While Reebok and VS sell different products and have different brand archetypes (VS displaying "the lover" archetype), both of them featuring Angel Reese makes it so that shoppers in both of these markets are exposed to her and her work.
