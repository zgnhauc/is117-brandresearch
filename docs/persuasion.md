# "THE CHOSEN ONE AND THE ONE WHO CHOSE"
<p> The header of the details page with information on this collab reads "The chosen one and the one who chose" in large, bold lettring. The primary brand that our group is looking at is Nike. This brand currently is promoting a collaboration with sports legend Lebron James. By featuring this collaboration with an athlete who many would consider a legend at this point lends them credibility as the go-to brand for these pros. Lebron James lends the brand authority as he is an established player of professional basketball. As most recently, Lebron and his son made history as the first ever father/son duo to play together in an NBA game, this collection uses undertones of royalty, as he is known as "the King" to really highlight this achievement. To his fans, this collaboration is a way to, even in a small part, continue to display their loyalty to him and the achievements he represents. Each shoe in the collection features a title and small blurb of the achievement it is based off of. Fans who have been following for a long time will recognize these probably off their names alone, which could further persuade them to purchase something from this collaboration.
